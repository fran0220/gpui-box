//! An **editable** markdown document.
//!
//! This is the model behind a markdown document a user can change and save
//! back out again: text goes in, blocks split and merge, and the result is
//! written to markdown that reads back as the same document. Its sibling
//! [`super::parse`] is a different thing entirely — a read-only render tree,
//! built to be drawn and never written.
//!
//! The two are deliberately separate, and neither can do the other's job. A
//! render tree is nested CommonMark: a list inside a quote inside a list is a
//! structure, which is exactly what a renderer needs to lay out and exactly
//! what makes every edit a restructure. This model is a **flat** list of
//! [`Block`]s carrying an indent level, so Enter splits, Backspace merges, and
//! Tab indents — all list operations, all local. Collapsing them into one type
//! would cost the renderer its nesting or the editor its flatness.
//!
//! The trade is that arbitrarily nested CommonMark does not survive a round
//! trip here: a list inside a quote inside a list flattens. What is guaranteed
//! is [`write`]'s fixed point — parse, serialize, parse again, and the
//! document is unchanged — so an edit/save cycle never drifts.
//!
//! Ported from the MIT-licensed `crabtalk/bezel` markdown crate; the import is
//! recorded in `PROVENANCE.md`.
